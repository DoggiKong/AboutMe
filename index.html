                    ~$ Hello World. My name is Jerry Wang
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am a Software Engineer based in Australia. My interest in programming started at the age of 12, when I first started tinkering with creating websites. In 2018, I obtained a degree  in <span class="keywords">Bachelor of Engineering</span>, majored in <span class="keywords">Software</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I moved to Australia from a young age. Australia has been my home for the majority of my life, and I still currently live here. I am fluent in both English and Chinese Mandarin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have a broad interest and experience in all aspects of technology, including and not limited to <span class="keywords">full-stack web development</span>, <span class="keywords">backend API systems</span>, <span class="keywords">mobile development</span> and <span class="keywords">hardwares & microcontrollers</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="truncate">Travelling the world is one of my favourite hobby. I set a yearly goal of visiting at least one foreign country. Some of the countries I've been to include: Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, UK, France, Italy and China. It is exciting to see the many different people, culture and scenaries and I still have plenty of exciting places on my bucket list!</span>
